# Simulation of a Spring Mass System

## Ever wondered what the the trajectory of a double pendulum would look like? Or even better: a triple pendulum? What about the placing of carbon atoms in a single-walled carbon nanotube? Now you can find out! Play around with this little simulation tool and see for yourself what's possible in the world of frictionless spring mass systems.
